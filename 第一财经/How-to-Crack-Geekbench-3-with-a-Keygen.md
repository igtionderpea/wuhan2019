A keygen is a program that generates valid license keys for a software. It can be used to bypass the software's activation process and use it for free. However, using a keygen is illegal and risky, as it may contain malware or viruses that can harm your computer. Therefore, we do not recommend using a keygen to crack Geekbench 3 or any other software.
 
If you still want to try it at your own risk, here are the steps you need to follow:
 
1. Download Geekbench 3 from its official website[^2^] and install it on your computer.
2. Download a keygen for Geekbench 3 from an unofficial source[^1^]. Be careful and scan it with an antivirus before running it.

Congratulations, you have successfully cracked Geekbench 3 with a keygen. However, this is not a permanent solution and you may face some problems in the future.
